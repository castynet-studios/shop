# Tracking & Privacy Policy

As of now we do not do any tracking, no cookies, no treats, no nothing.

Sometime in the future we might do some tracking to have the stats of how many hits the site gets, and what the users are most interested in. This will help us have a better understanding of what you like & what you are interested in.

If that happens you can check back here we'll have updated this page with all the juicy details.
